Created a simple app that has an API endpoint (localhost:8080/api/data) and return the data that was provided to me and it is located under Mocks > data.js
This is to simulate a true case scenario where there's an API and client will fetch the data.

Nothing fancy, written in JavaScript using NodeJS ExpressJS Framework. Just hosting a server for FE Development to progress with quality code.

Steps:

- Just install the packages inside with npm install
- Once done, inside the directory, type node app.js or if you have nodemon, nodemon app.js
- If successful, it should display "Serving at port 8080!" on the console of your IDE.
