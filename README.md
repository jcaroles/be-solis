Created a simple app that has an API endpoint and return the data that was provided to me and it is locked under Mocks > data.js
This is to simulate a true case scenario where there's an API and client will fetch the data

Nothing fancy. Just hosting a server for FE Development to progress with quality code.

Steps:

- Just install the packages inside
- type node app.js or if you have nodemon, nodemon app.js
- It should display "Serving at port 8080!" in the console of your IDE

Reach out to the developer for any questions or concerns!
